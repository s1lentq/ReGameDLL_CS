Reverse-engineered gamedll (mp.dll / Counter-Strike)

## What is this?
Regamedll_CS is a result of reverse engineering of original library mod HLDS (build 6153beta) using DWARF debug info embedded into linux version of HLDS, cs.so

## Goals of the project
* Provide more stable (than official) version of Counter-Strike game with extended API for mods and plugins

## How can use it?
ReGameDLL_CS is fully compatible with official mod CS 1.6 / CZero by Valve. All you have to do is to download binaries and replace original mp.dll/cs.so

## Downloads
* [Release builds](https://github.com/s1lentq/ReGameDLL_CS/releases)
* [Dev builds](https://github.com/s1lentq/ReGameDLL_CS/actions/workflows/build.yml)

<b>Warning!</b> ReGameDLL_CS is not binary compatible with original hlds since it's compiled with compilers other than ones used for original mod CS.
This means that plugins that do binary code analysis (Orpheu for example) probably will not work with ReGameDLL_CS.

## How can use beta?
<pre>ReGameDLL_CS also have beta version with latest changes from official version of Counter-Strike.</pre>
* Enter `-beta` option at the command line HLDS.

## Build instructions
### Checking requirements
There are several software requirements for building ReGameDLL_CS:

#### Windows
<pre>
Visual Studio 2015 (C++14 standard) and later
</pre>

#### Linux
<pre>
git >= 1.8.5
cmake >= 3.10
GCC >= 4.9.2 (Optional)
ICC >= 15.0.1 20141023 (Optional)
LLVM (Clang) >= 6.0 (Optional)
</pre>

### Building

#### Windows
Use `Visual Studio` to build, open `msvc/ReGameDLL.sln` and just select from the solution configurations list `Release` or `Debug`

#### Linux

* Optional options using `build.sh --compiler=[gcc] --jobs=[N] -D[option]=[ON or OFF]` (without square brackets)

<pre>
-c=|--compiler=[icc|gcc|clang]  - Select preferred C/C++ compiler to build
-j=|--jobs=[N]                  - Specifies the number of jobs (commands) to run simultaneously (For faster building)

<sub>Definitions (-D)</sub>
DEBUG                           - Enables debugging mode
USE_STATIC_LIBSTDC              - Enables static linking library libstdc++
</pre>

* ICC          <pre>./build.sh --compiler=intel</pre>
* LLVM (Clang) <pre>./build.sh --compiler=clang</pre>
* GCC          <pre>./build.sh --compiler=gcc</pre>
